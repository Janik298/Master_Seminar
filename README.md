Journey for my Master Seminar Paper about Intermediary Asset Pricing and a semi-parametric approach.

## Abstract
We will investigate the intermediary asset pricing model proposed by Sa Mai (2024) and his approach. We will also provide a semi-parametric approach to the model and compare the results with the original model to verify the accuracy of the model.

## Introduction
The intermediary asset pricing model proposed by Sa Mai (2024) is a model that explains the relationship between intermediary asset pricing and the risk premium. The model is based on the assumption that the intermediary asset pricing is determined by the risk premium, which is the difference between the expected return on the asset and the risk-free rate. The model also assumes that the intermediary asset pricing is influenced by the risk aversion of the intermediary, which is the degree to which the intermediary is willing to take on risk in exchange for higher returns. Moreover, we assume that our intermediaries are heterogeneous.
