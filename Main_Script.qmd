## Synopsis
We will use this document to write our seminar paper. We will use the `quarto` package to write the paper in a literate programming style. This means that we will write the paper in a single document that includes both the content and the code used to generate the content. This will allow us to easily reproduce the results in the paper. Furthermore, we will submit a separate pdf file that only includes the text without the need to run the code. Moreover, we will use the `quarto` package to generate the pdf file where the code is hidden. 

## Introduction

In this paper, we will investigate the intermediary asset pricing model proposed by Sa Mai (2023) where a semi parametric approach was used in to model the heterogeneous intermediary stochastic discount factor (HI-SDF)
